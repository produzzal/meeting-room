Welcome to my Meeting Room Booking System. This web application makes it easy to reserve rooms for meetings. Administrators can manage room details such as names, numbers, floors, capacities, and amenities effortlessly. They can also set up available times when rooms can be booked. Users will find a friendly interface where they can choose rooms and book available times for their meetings. The system shows real-time information on room availability to prevent double bookings and ensure smooth bookings.my goal is to make it simple for administrators to manage spaces and for users to book rooms efficiently.
